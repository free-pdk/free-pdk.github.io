# PMS15A

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
The PMS15A may just a marketing name for the [PMS150C](/chips/PMS150C).
The PMS15A we got appeared to be identical to the PMS150C and had the same ROM size.
The ROM size restriction is only enforced when using the official IDE.
**Of course we can't guarantee that Padauk doesn't change this in the future.**
